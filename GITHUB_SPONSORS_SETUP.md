## Tips for Success

### Write a compelling "About" section:
```
I'm building PWA-Kit, the open-source toolkit for creating lightweight progressive web apps on macOS.

Safari's PWAs use 200-300MB RAM per app. PWA-Kit targets <100MB.

Closed-source alternatives like Unite ($20) and Coherence ($15) are buggy and expensive. PWA-Kit is free, open-source, and community-driven.

Your sponsorship helps me:
- Optimize memory usage
- Fix bugs faster
- Add new features
- Build PWAKitBuilder GUI app
- Support the community

Thank you for considering! Every dollar helps make PWA-Kit better. ❤️
```

### Profile goals:
- Month 1: 5 sponsors ($50/month total)
- Month 3: 20 sponsors ($300/month total)
- Month 6: 50 sponsors ($800/month total)
- Month 12: 100 sponsors ($1,500/month total)

### Marketing:
- Add sponsor badge to README
- Tweet about sponsorship milestones
- Thank sponsors publicly
- Share progress updates monthly
- Show sponsor logos on future website
